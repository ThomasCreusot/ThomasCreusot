# Welcome to my github profile !

- 🔭 Scientist by training -> 5 years of experience in the field of health and environment 🌱
- 💻 Each professional experience -> the opportunity to design IT tools (self-taught) adapter to the user needs and constraints of different departments (laboratories, start-ups, etc.).
- 👯 I realised how much IT tools interest me: communication, perspective, design, practicality, concrete and adapted solutions! 
- 🤔 Development took a growing part in my professional agenda and I decided to consolidate my knowledge with a training (Python scripts, optimized algorithms, web applications (Django framework for the architecture, use of JavaScript for the dynamics of the pages) and APIs)
- 🧠 My ability to learn is developed, and the soft skills I have acquired during my career allow me to solve problems by adapting.
- ❤️ Respect, trust and authenticity are the values that guide me every day.

- You will find on my GitHub profile : 
-- The professionalization projects of the OpenClassrooms Software Developer - Python Application Developer course
-- My personal project Part(d)age which brings together many of the skills I acquired during the OpenClassrooms course, allows me to practice on a daily basis and to continue learning, and (I hope) will facilitate my job search.

To find out more about the professional projects I've done and my background, I invite you to visit [my linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/th-creusot/) and to contact me on this platform. 

Wish you a great day !
